# Metalama.Extensions

This repo contains the open-source extensions to Metalama.Framework:

* `Metalama.Extensions.DependencyInjection` is a framework that allows aspects to consume dependencies from an arbitrary dependency injection framework.
* `Metalama.Extensions.Metrics` implements code metrics that can be consumed by aspects and fabrics.
* `Metalama.Extensions.Multicast` simulates the legacy PostSharp attribute multicasting to ease the migration from PostSharp to Metalama.
