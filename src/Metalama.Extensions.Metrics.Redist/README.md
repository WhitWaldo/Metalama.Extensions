The  `Metalama.Extensions.Metrics.Redist` package contains the redistribution files of the `Metalama.Extensions.Metrics` package. Referencing this package instead of `Metalama.Extensions.Metrics` does not cause the referencing packages to be processed by Metalama, i.e. the standard C# compiler is not replaced by the Metalama compiler.

## Backward Compatibility Promise

All public APIs are guaranteed to be backward compatible within the current major version.

The promise does not apply to any preview build of this package.
